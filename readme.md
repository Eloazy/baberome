This API is an initiative and built by just one developer being for private and non-profit use. ‚ù§Ô∏è

# Documentation üìö

## Models üß†

> not supported yet

## Connection üîó

Done by `POST` method accessing `localhost on port 1025`
Receiving and sending only information in `application/json`

return the response in `result`

> [!NOTE]
> BabelRome still DOES NOT HAVE A CONNECTION with **babelite**

## How Use

It is a very limited and very simplified system, when you click on the `Chrome extensions tab` you will click on `babel` and click on `extract`
with this the data will be registered in **babelite**

To access them you will need to go to Babelite and ask the question of what you want to get from that data, example:
`Give me all informations from this html`
`Give me a resume of the contents of this html`
`Tell me what u see from this html`

> [!TIP]
> Telling babel to visualize it as an HTML will make it respond directly and with fewer errors

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Baberome sends the message to the SAME model as babelite, if you access another model, it will not be included in their memory, use the same model


## Key instructions üîë
